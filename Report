Executive Summary 
This report delves into the critical cybersecurity incident involving the Lenovo-Superfish adware in 2015, offering insights into the man-in-the-middle attack vector it exploited. Commencing in September 2014, Lenovo PCs were equipped with pre-installed Superfish VisualDiscovery software, designed to intercept user web traffic for targeted advertisements (CYBERSECURITY & INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY [CISA], 2016, para. 2). 
The adware implemented a classic man-in-the-middle attack by installing a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate, allowing it to intercept and decrypt encrypted connections (HTTP). The inherent risk lies in the fact that Superfish's CA-signed certificates masked the interception, rendering the browser incapable of displaying warnings about tampered web traffic. This vulnerability created a breeding ground for potential cyber-attacks, enabling attackers to generate certificates using Superfish's private key. Exploiting this, an attacker could intercept traffic on shared networks, like public Wi-Fi, and impersonate users, spoofing sensitive information such as email and banking details without triggering browser warnings (CISA, 2016, para. 2).
In response to the discovered vulnerability, Lenovo ceased pre-installing Superfish VisualDiscovery. However, existing systems with the software remained susceptible until users actively uninstalled it (CISA, 2016, para. 3).
This report emphasizes the severity of man-in-the-middle attacks and the nuanced vulnerabilities they exploit, as illustrated by the Superfish case study. Additionally, it provides recommendations for effectively countering such attacks.

Types of  MitM attacks
To gain access to devices and sensitive information, cybercriminals use the following ways to conduct MitM attacks:
1.	Internet Protocol spoofing. Like identity theft, IP spoofing takes place when cybercriminals alter the source IP address of a website, email address or device for the purpose of masking it. This dupes the users into believing that they are interacting with a legit source and the sensitive information they share during the transaction gets transferred to the cybercriminals instead.
2.	Domain Name System spoofing. This is a type of man-in-the-middle attack where cybercriminals alter domain names to redirect traffic to fake websites. Users might think that they are reaching a secure and trusted website, but instead, they land on a website operated by cybercriminals. The main aim behind DNS spoofing is to reroute traffic to a fake website or to capture user login credentials.
3.	HTTP spoofing. The HTTP protocol is the embodiment of secure internet communications. HTTPS indicates a safe and trusted website. During an HTTPS spoofing attack, a browser session is redirected to an unsecured or HTTP-based website without the user's knowledge or consent. Cybercriminals can monitor user interactions and steal shared personal information through this redirection.
4.	Secure Sockets Layer hijacking. SSL is a protocol that establishes an encrypted connection between a browser and the web server. During SSL hijacking, a cybercriminal might use another computer and a secure server to intercept all information traveling between the server and the end user's computer.
5.	Email hijacking. This is a type of MitM attack where cybercriminals gain control of email accounts of banks and other financial institutions to monitor any transactions that users conduct. Cybercriminals may even spoof the bank's email address and send instructions to customers that lead them to unknowingly transfer their money to the cybercriminals.
6.	Wi-Fi eavesdropping. This MitM attack is one of the many risk factors posed by public Wi-Fi. During this attack, public Wi-Fi users get tricked into connecting to malicious Wi-Fi networks and hotspots. Cybercriminals accomplish this by setting up Wi-Fi connections with names that resemble nearby businesses.
7.	Session hijacking. Also known as stealing browser cookies, this malicious practice takes place when cybercriminals steal personal data and passwords stored inside the cookies of a user's browsing session. Sometimes, cybercriminals can gain endless access to users' saved resources. For example, they might steal users' confidential data and identities, purchase items or steal money from their bank accounts.
8.	Cache poisoning. Also known as Address Resolution Protocol, or ARP cache poisoning, this popular modern-day MitM attack enables cybercriminals who are on the same subnet as the victims to eavesdrop on all traffic being routed between them.
